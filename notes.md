# Development Notes

## Vision

This is your go-to place to showcase "your favorites" when it comes to books, shows, movies, bands, podcasts, youtubers, and all other sorts of media.

Check out what your friends like, what your crush likes, discover new creators you'll love, and share your latest binge sessions.

## Potential features

- Have an enormous database of content (books, shows, movies, artists) - these will be user-driven for now.
- Integrate with lots of APIs to pull in data like Spotify, Netflix, Goodreads, to pull in data.
- Have a ton of content types:
    - Books
    - TV Shows
    - Movies
    - Music
    - Podcasts
    - Youtubers
    - Subreddits
    - Video games
    - Board games
    - Blogs?
    - Be able to add more content types as needed
- Users add content they like to their profile (a.k.a. escape pod?)
- Users can follow other users, this means their posts will show up in their feed
- Users can connect Facebook to help find existing connections
- Users can connect Instagram to help find existing connections
- Users can have a "Top 5" on their profile, which is their lifetime top 5 all time favourite anything
- Users can post certain types of activity, but I think all the posts will be presets, they won't be able to type any text. I don't think I want the platform to be about sharing messages
- Users have an activity feed (or a "passivity feed" perhaps) that shows posts and other time-based content.
    - Posts from people you are following
    - "Suggested for you" posts from people you aren't following
    - Targeted ads eventually?
- Users can react to posts from other users (a simple "like" or heart sort of reaction). I don't think there will be any comment feature though. Maybe?
- One type of post will be what they're watching "right now" (e.g. show status for the next hour or until changed)
- One type of post will be when a user adds a new content to their profile, they can optionally share it as a post. If its a book they can specify "reading for the first time" or "completed". Same with TV series, maybe other types of series. Not so much for movies or music.
- Users can indicate which content they spent time on today. This wouldn't really be a post, more of a "activity tracker"
- For books/TV shows, users should be able to also update their profile with how far along they are (which page or episode).
- Users can see their own/other's "recent activity" aggregated in some form (e.g. what is that user watching/reading lately)
- If a user doesn't find the book/show they're looking for in the search, then they can add it to the database for all users to see. I think each piece of content needs to have an image and some basic info. We should keep track of which users added which content so we can do badges or something.
- Users can enable notifications for a person/interest combo based on the "right now" feature. That way if that person says their watching The Office, then you'll get notified and you could reach out - maybe you want to watch with them or something? The notification should disappear if it isn't seen within 30 minutes or something.
- We want to give general insights: "a lot of people with similar interests as you are recently watching X"
